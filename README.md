# Predicting-Obesity-Level-Using-Logistic-Regression-Algorithm
This project will help to predict the obesity level, using machine learning algorithm. This will be based on a data regarding eating habits and physical condition of individuals from the countries of Mexico, Peru and Colombia. The model will try to find patterns to predict the column variable **NObesity** (Obesity Level). It is worth to mention that 77% of the data was generated synthetically using the Weka tool and the SMOTE filter, 23% of the data was collected directly from users through a web platform.
